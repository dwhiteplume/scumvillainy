# Scum & Villainy

You are a bounty hunter, a smuggler, a ronin, on the run from The Empire. Whatever your story, desperate times call for desperate measures.

## Two Paths

This is a [*Lasers & Feelings*](https://johnharper.itch.io/lasers-feelings) styled game. Players choose a *number* between two and five. When attempting an action with consequences roll a d6. Your *number* and below for **Scum** actions and your *number* or higher for **Villainy**.

### Scum

Brute force, fire fights, survival in harsh climes, ship repair, mechanical item repair and fabrication, ship gunnery.

### Villainy

Coersion, sense motive, foresight, tactics, droid repair and fabrication, ship piloting.

## Adjudication

When a desired action has consequences, decide the appropriate **Path** and roll a die. If a character has some advantage, allow them another die. If the character is specifically prepared for the action, allow them an another die.

### Special: Mystic Knights

Mystic Knights, or those who weild similar power, still use **Scum** and **Villainy** rolls, but get an additional die if specifically calling upon their power. When their **Power** is used it aftects their balance one way or another. Success in a **Path** moves the weilder's *number* in favor of that **Path**. Failure moves the weilder's *number* in favor of the other. The *number* remains until it is moved again by action, the end of the session, or the Knight has time to meditate and realign.

> **Example**
> 
> A Knight is trapped behind cover. Troopers are firing on the Knight's position, but when the time is right the Knight comes out of cover and weilds their **Power** to pull the blasters from their hands. The Knight's *number* is 3 (three) and rolls their **Scum** successfully. Their *number* now moves to 4 (four), making further **Scum** rolls easier, but making **Villainy** rolls more difficult.
